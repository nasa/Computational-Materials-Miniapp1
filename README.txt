# Computational-Materials-Miniapp1-

This mini-app is a simple test code for calculating potential energy, 
forces and stresses of an atomistic structure using EAM potential.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
* Linux
* FORTRAN compiler (2003 or newer)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit the provided makefile for specific compiler option of your choice
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation: use the provided makefile with the following options:
> make            ! compiles with -O3 optimization on !
> make DEBUG=TRUE ! compiles with check and warning flags on !

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example (test) directory:
./CM_MINI1.test

Running a tets case:
run CM_mini1.bat script from CM_MINI1.test directory:
> CM_mini1.bat

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Required input files:

pot.dat - interatomic potential setup file
./NiCoAl_dat  - folder with potential files as described in pot.dat
structure.plt - input atomic structure file

--- Available test structures ---
in STR directory:
Ni85Al15_N4k.plt - 4,000 atoms Ni3Al crystal
Ni85Al15_N64k.plt - 64,000 atoms Ni3Al crystal
Ni85Al15_N256k.plt - 256,000 atoms Ni3Al crystal
 
Use any of the above structures by linking them to structure.plt, e.g.,
ln -s ./STR/Al_N500_T100K.plt structure.plt
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution:   

cd ../CM_MINI1.test
./CM_mini1

Execution options: (see also ./CM_MINI1.test/CM_mini1.bat script)

./CM_mini1           # run, using default options - see below
./CM_mini1 -n 10     # do 10 itterations (default: -n 1)
./CM_mini1 -n 10 -r  # do 10 itterations with random changes
                     # (default: no randomization)
./CM_mini1 -v 1      # run version 1 (default: -v 0) - gives a possibility
                     # to test different versions of a subroutine.
                     # currently: -v 0 executes the code using
                     # subroutine get_neighbors (CM_mini1.f)
                     # while -v 1 executes the code using
                     # subroutine get_neighbors_vect (CM_mini1.f)
                     # see subroutine force_global(iver):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
       select case (iver)
        case(0) 
         call get_neighbors
        case(1) 
         call get_neighbors_vect
        case default 
         call get_neighbors
       end select
